This repository is created to practice the core of Git/GitHub workflows.

# Findings

- Netflix's library volume is heavily weighted toward recent years rather than a gradual accumulation over time. The vast majority of the content was added between 2016 and 2021.
- The volume of movies added has been greater than the volume of TV shows added for almost all the years included in the dataset.
